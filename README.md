# U5Lzw

These are crudely and hastily written programs just to get stuff working,
rather than properly writing the code and understanding exactly what was
going on.  Thus, they're poorly coded.

U5AppleTiles extracts the graphics from SHAPES binary file found on the
first disk of the Apple II Ultima V version.

U5Lzw will compress or decompress LZW files from Ultima V.

u5tiles2png will convert those decompressed files from the above to or
from a png file, provided you use the correct palette.
